# Predicting Boston Housing Prices

This is project implements a Decision Tree Regressor to predict the prices of a house in Boston given certain features. It utilizes the Boston housing dataset from the sklearn library. It was built as part of a project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.

The project also plots how the depth of the decision tree affects the error values of predicting samples from the training set and testing set. As the decision tree uses a higher depth, the model overfits and the error value decreases on the training set while the error value increases or remains fairly level on the testing data.

### Usage

In the terminal, simply run the program using python:

```bash
python boston_housing.py
```
